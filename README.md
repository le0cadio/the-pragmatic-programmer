Take responsibility for yourself and your career, and don't be afraid to show mistakes. Grow from them.  
Mistakes happen. Be honest.

When you make a mistake or a wrong decision, admit it honestly and try to offer options. Don't blame others or invent excuses. It's up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

Given options, don't send blame or excuses.
