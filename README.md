These are **only** my notes and thoughts about the book. This repository does not replace reading the book.  
Nothing, I repeat, nothing will be better than buying, reading the book, and having your own insights.



# **Chapter 1 - A Pragmatic Philosophy**
-   Understand your context. By doing this, you know EXACTLY where and how good your software needs to be.

-   Interact with other people. Build in public. Think in public. Use social media in your favor. Communicate and above all, THINK.

Take responsibility for yourself and your career, and don't be afraid to show mistakes. Grow from them.  
Mistakes happen. Be honest.

When you make a mistake or a wrong decision, admit it honestly and try to offer options. Don't blame others or invent excuses. It's up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

- "Provide options, not lame excuses"

#2  Software Entropy
-
Entropy = Disorder.

Garbage == More Garbage. 

Don't accept garbage and broken windows.
- Attack the smaller problems to avoid the big ones. 
- Pay attention to minor issues.
